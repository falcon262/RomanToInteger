# RomanToInteger
My solution to the Roman Numeral to Integer problem. Giving any roman numeral or combination of numerals, the corresponding Integer is returned. 
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.
However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV and other giving combinations following roman numeric rules.
